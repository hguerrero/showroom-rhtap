== AI with LLMs Demo Setup

In this module we will show you the *setup* steps, the things you do BEFORE going on stage,  and introduce you to a new template that provisions both the SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) and the MDLC (Model Development Lifecycle). Where the SDLC is implemented as a Tekton-based Trusted Application Pipeline as seen in previous modules and the MDLC is implemented as a Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) pipeline based on Kubeflow. 

Where RHOAI is responsible for the LLM serving, management, and monitoring.  

Where RHTAP + RHDH is responsible for the application code pipeline and lifecycle.

=== Setup

LLMs take a fair bit of time to "spawn" within their pod, use the cooking show technique by running the template once *BEFORE* taking the stage, before sharing your screen.

The primary template to run is called *Secured Chatbot with a Self-Hosted Large Language Model (LLM)*. The best way to learn about this template is to execute it. 

Start a new project, an application that leverages a LLM for Natural Language Processing (NLP).  The creation of a net new LLM-infused microservice is as simple as clicking *Choose* on the *Secured Chatbot with a Self-Hosted Large Language Model (LLM)* template.  

Fill-in some fields and follow the wizard:

Name: *marketingbot*

Group Id: *redhat.janus*

Artifact Id: *marketingbot*

Java Package Name: *org.redhat.janus*

Description: *A LLM infused marketingbot app*

Click *Next*

Model Name: *parasol-instruct*

Note: Expanding the list of model names in the screenshot will be covered later, for now, just pick the one you have access to which is *parasol-instruct* out-of-the-box.

Click *Next*

For Image Registry, keep all the defaults

Click *Next*

For Repository Location, keep all the defaults

Click *Review*

Click *Create*

The animation takes few seconds however this hides the heavy lifting happening under the covers.

Click on *Open Component in catalog*

image::chatbot-9.png[]

Click on *CD* tab

Look for *Healthy* under the *-ai-build* application

Click on the *Overview tab* and then *RHOAI Data Science Project*

Login in via *rhsso* and the provided password

Look at the *Deployed Models* section, it is very likely that you do not yet have a green check mark indicating that the model server is in fact up.  It can take several minutes for the model server to be ready.

The green check mark is important.  Again, use the cooking show technique and "pull the baked cake out of the oven".

Now, you are ready to begin the basic demo flow.
