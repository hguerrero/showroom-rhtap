=== Cluster Sleep/Wake

demo.redhat.com will *auto-stop* or essentially sleep your cluster, upon restart/wake enterprise contract is likely to fail as the Rekor public key chances upon cluster awakening. Enterprise contract being part of the promotion pipeline used with a GitLab tag or release event.

1. The new Rekor public key needs to be downloaded
2. You need to login to the in-cluster Vault via its token
3. You update the public key of *janusidp/rekor* with the new Rekor public key


Via script

----
REKOR_SERVER=https://$(oc get route rekor-server -n rekor -o json | jq -r .spec.host)
curl $REKOR_SERVER/api/v1/log/publicKey > public.key
oc exec vault-0 -n vault -- vault kv put kv/secrets/janusidp/rekor public_key="$(cat public.key)"
----

or the manual way


Download the Rekor public key by visit YOUR unique version of the following URL:

https://rekor-server-rekor.apps.cluster-z7zmt.sandbox2366.opentlc.com/api/v1/log/publicKey

"z7zmt.sandbox2366" will be unique to your cluster and this string is visible at demo.redhat.com

Then extract the vault token by using the *oc* or *kubectl* command line.

----
TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret vault-token -n vault -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode)
echo $TOKEN
----


Use that token to login Vault. Again updating the following URL to reflect your specific cluster's identity. 

https://vault-vault.apps.cluster-z7zmt.sandbox2366.opentlc.com/ui/vault/secrets/kv/show/secrets/janusidp/rekor

Paste in the contents from downloaded key from 

https://rekor-server-rekor.apps.cluster-z7zmt.sandbox2366.opentlc.com/api/v1/log/publicKey

Note: After this change wait about 10 seconds to use the promotion pipeline (tag, release).  The *rekor-public-key* in the -dev, -pre-prod and -prod namespaces need to be updated.
